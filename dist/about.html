          <p>
            I'm a Graphic Design student at the Metropolitan University of
            Belgrade with more than 6 years of experience with Photoshop and
            Illustrator. Efficient, quick and a perfectionist, I've been drawing
            digital art for games almost all my life and enjoy designing
            anything media-related, be it movie posters, ad campaigns, concept
            art, illustration, UI, etc. <br /><br />I can deliver original,
            professional-quality photography for designs, or illustrate
            something completely new both digitally or traditionally. <br />In
            some scenarios, 3D modeling might be needed for a design or
            illustration project, in which case I can use Blender software to
            deliver quality renders quickly. <br /><br />All of my designs,
            drawings or models are done on a powerful rig, ensuring nothing but
            top quality and quick completion.

          <p>
            Apart from doing graphic design, I also heavily enjoy gaming, I've
            written several unpublished novels which have perfected my knowledge
            of the English language, I also have a healthy obsession with the
            gym. Much like any other designer, I enjoy photography and
            calligraphy.
            <br /><br />I recently started a Game Development project where I
            lead around 10 of my colleagues, all working in tandem to create a
            video game under the name "The Forest Beckons". This project, though
            still a work-in-progress, has reignited the spark for illustration
            and asset design in me, as well as taught me several important
            skills, including - leadership, game design, Unity (software),
            texture and asset design, etc. <br /><br />I have been DM-ing for a
            large D&D tabletop campaign almost as long as i've been drawing /
            doing design - an experience which has taught me many things,
            including teamwork, game balance, storytelling, narrative,
            illustration and design for tabletop, etc.
